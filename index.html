  <p>**Stance detection** is the extraction of a people's reaction to a claim made by a primary actor. 
    It is a core part of a set of approaches to capture political trends. 
    Companies are sensitive to political policies. It could bring them a lot of benefits, 
    such as the fund, the support from the government, if they could catch up with political trends beforehand.
