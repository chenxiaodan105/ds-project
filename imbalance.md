### Overview

Possible solutions for imbalance data handling:
* Resampling
* Tune hyperparameters for different machine learning models
* Go back to check data

### Method 1: Resampling
* balanced ensemble method

### Method 2: Change ML Models Class Weight

### Method 3: Relabeling Model

**Let's look at the change from the perspective: quantity**
